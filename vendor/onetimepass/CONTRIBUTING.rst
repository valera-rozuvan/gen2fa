Rules of contributing in ``onetimepass`` module
===============================================

TL;DR
-----

There are three most valuable ways of contributing to onetimepass:

#. Submitting issues / tickets with errors or feature requests,
#. Submitting tests reproducing the issues or showing expected functionality,
#. Contributing with code,

Whatever you will choose, it is always advised to attach code samples (like
tests) and error messages, so the solution may be properly assessed.

Steps for contribution
----------------------

Currently, there are no rules. Until this is solved out, if you urgently need
to add or fix something, it is advised to:

#. First create a task (issue) on `GitHub repository page
   <https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass/issues>`_.
#. Then, prepare a change in separate branch in your own repository, preferably
   named in the following manner: ``{issue-no}-{lowercase-description}``, for
   example: "``1-support-for-lowercase-secrets``".
#. Add tests to it (at the time of writing it, ``doctest`` is the suite we are
   using).
#. Issue a `pull request <https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass/pulls>`_ on
   GitHub.

All contributions are welcome. If you would like to improve the contribution
process, please `add an issue <https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass/issues>`_
regarding that with your proposal in it.

Thank you!
